# To-Do List (Features I Can't Implement)

*   I am unable to run external tools to perform testing.
*   I cannot provide a demonstration to your tutor.
*   I am unable to send SMS messages for password resets.
*   I cannot generate API keys for external services like Google reCAPTCHA. You will need to generate these yourself and add them to the `appsettings.json` file.
*   I cannot run Package Manager Console commands like `Add-Migration` or `Update-Database`. You will need to run these commands to create and update your database.
